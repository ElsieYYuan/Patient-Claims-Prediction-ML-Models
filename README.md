# 🏥 Patient Claims Prediction ML Models

**Predicting Healthcare Claims Using Patient Profiles**  
*Leveraging Machine Learning to forecast claim amounts based on patient demographics, conditions, and past costs.*

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project builds machine learning models to predict healthcare claims, based on a dataset of 14,000 patient profiles from the past five years. By accurately forecasting claims, this project supports smarter decision-making for insurance providers, helping to manage risk and optimize reserves.

---

## 🔑 Key Features

- **Data Processing:** Combined and cleaned JSON profile data, engineered key features such as chronic condition severity and outpatient cost growth rates.
- **Multi-Model Comparison:** Developed and evaluated a variety of models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost
  - LightGBM
  - CatBoost (best-performing model)
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 96.96% accuracy on the validation set with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 658.07.

---

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Feature Importance:** Recent outpatient costs (especially 2023) and chronic conditions (AT, DB, HD, HT) were identified as top predictors.
- **Impact of Feature Engineering:** Introducing feature combinations like growth rates and chronic condition severity improved model accuracy, but refining growth rate calculations had a limited effect.
- **Best Model:** CatBoost outperformed other models by capturing non-linear patterns, indicating complex relationships between chronic conditions and claims.
